/**
 * <b>Introduction</b> <br><br>
 *
 * This is an abstract class for a Spock-Lizard player. All players
 * <i>must</i> extend this class, and <i>must</i> be part of the <i>players</i>
 * package.<br><Br>
 *
 * The players decide their move for each game (one of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock,
 * or Lizard. The arena is the referee and decides who won, then communicates the
 * result to each player. <br><br>
 *
 * <b>Rules</b><ol>
 *
 * <li>You must use the constants defined in this class to communicate your moves
 * to the arena. The values of these constants might change on game day.</li>
 *
 * <li>You may use other "helper" classes, but spawning threads or timers for any
 * purpose other than animating your logo is not allowed.</li>
 *
 * <li>You must specify a name and a visual for your bot, using the appropriate
 * methods below. Any images used must be stored in the <i>images</i> folder.</li>
 *
 * <li>You must not use <i>any</i> method of pseudo-random number generation. The aim of
 * this task is to predict and beat your opponent's move, not to try to be
 * unpredictable yourself.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <br>
 * <b>Rubric</b><br><br>
 *
 * To get an A+, your player should meet all of the following criteria:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Your code must meet all the standards and rules set out in this documentation.</li>
 * <li>Your code must be fully documented to javadoc standards.</li>
 * <li>Your strategy must be completely described in the class header. It should be well thought out
 * and ambitious.</li>
 * <li>Your code must be commented in a way that makes it clear where and how the different
 * parts of your strategy are implemented.</li>
 * <li>Your strategy must make use of array processing techniques to predict your opponent's move.</li>
 * <li>Your code must be as efficient as possible. There should be no superfluous or unnecessary
 * comparison or assignment operations.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <br>
 * <b>More Information</b><br><br>
